# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan Thomas Jacob

🧪 Curious, Still Finding My Niche

## 🧠 About Me

Still exploring the vast world of programming. I’ve worked across **mobile app development, AI projects, web tech, and game development** — and I enjoy diving into new languages and domains to expand my skillset.

- 💻 I've built apps using **Flutter**, **React**, and native **Android**
- 🤖 I've worked on **AI/ML projects** using Python
- 🎮 Worked with 10+ Game dev teams on projects for itch.io, Roblox and Gamejams
- 🧩 Still experimenting with new ideas to find what excites me the most

I love building, learning, and occasionally getting lost in a late-night debug spiral 😄
